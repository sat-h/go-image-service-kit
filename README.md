# Go Image Service Kit Project

**Go Image Service Kit** is a modular, scalable image processing service built in Go. It provides a simple and efficient solution for uploading, processing, and storing images. The project is designed to grow incrementally, with initial focus on basic image processing and storage. As it evolves, additional features like caching, monitoring, and user authentication will be added.

## Tech Stack

- **Go**: Backend service for image processing and API handling.
- **Amazon S3**: Cloud storage for storing images.
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing image metadata.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD for automating build, testing, and deployment.
- **Docker**: For local development and testing in containers.
- - **Zap**: Structured, high-performance logging for the image service.

## Goals for the MVP

The **Go Image Service Kit** aims to provide a lightweight and efficient solution for image upload and processing with scalability in mind. The initial version will focus on:

1. Image upload to Amazon S3.
2. Basic image processing (resizing, format conversion).
3. Storing image metadata in DynamoDB.
4. A basic CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and building.
